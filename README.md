# NaviCenta Application Note

The placenta remains the key organ to pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia. Contrarily, the pathophysiology of placental disorders remains elusive. Here, we present “NaviCenta”, a Disease Map based on molecular interaction networks to support placenta research. In particular, molecular interaction (sub)maps were built in CellDesigner using publicly available information , i.e., literature, pathway, and Omics data. Thus, NaviCenta serves as an open access, spatio-temporal multi-scale approach that facilitates placenta research as a knowledge base and analytical tool for  enhanced interpretation and hypothesis testing.

This repository serves as a source for additional information on the NaviCenta, its' content, architecture, and applications.
