# Known Disease-Related Molecules

The NaviCenta maps were generated by scanning databases and articles to identify relevant processes and phenotypes. Additionally, known disease-related molecules were obtained from [DisGeNET](https://www.disgenet.org/).

This project is part of [iPlacenta](https://www.iplacenta.eu/) a European Union Horizon 2020 innnovative training network under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action. Related projects primarily focus on pre-eclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).
Therefore, the chosen disease-related genes chosen for the following diseases:

| CUI      | Disease |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| C0810330      | preeclampsia and eclampsia       |
| C0032914   | Pre-Eclampsia        | 
| C0565599   | Maternal hypertension        | 
| C4230888   | Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)        | 
| C1386048   | Intrauterine retardation       |
